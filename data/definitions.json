Romanesco cauliflower (sometimes broccoli Romanesco or Roman broccoli) has spiky turreted points; it is a traditional variety from the region near Rome with refined, nutty flavor.

"cheese":"Milk in solid and less perishable form, essentially a nutritious convenience food. The basic method for making cheese is the same for all milk: rennet (from the lining of a calf’s or kid’s stomach, or from a vegetable source) is introduced to warm milk, causing the solids to coagulate into a mass of curds. With time, perhaps also heat and pressure, the molded curd releases the watery whey, retaining in the solid curd most of the nutrients, to be eaten fresh or aged in infinite variations. This fermentation process, related to making bread, beer, and wine, protects the cheese from spoiling. Cave paintings in the Saharan desert from at least 5000 B.C. show milking and what is probably cheese making; a Sumerian bas relief of 3500 B.C. depicts in detail the entire process.

"chili":"The fruit of the pepper plant, from the genus Capsicum, ranging in its many varieties from mild to fiery hot, along with other flavor components; the chili’s pungency is concentrated in the capsaicin in the white rib tissue and attached seeds, which should be handled with care or even plastic disposable gloves. In general, smaller peppers are hotter than larger ones, and as they ripen from green to yellow to red, their flavor changes and gains heat. The fire can be measured in Scoville Heat Units, a scientific method devised in 1912, which allots 0 for a bell pepper, 4,000 to 10,000 for a jalapeño, and 300,000 for the hottest habanero. With repeated consumption, the chili eater gains tolerance, also a seeming addiction. Originating in South America, chili peppers are used in many cuisines the world over, with regional preferences. In common usage the word chili implies hot peppers, no botanical relation to black pepper, an error first made by Columbus, who thought the chilies he found in the West Indies were the black pepper of the Indies. The plural of the Spanish word chile is chiles; the English spelling is either chili (American) or chilli (more often British), with the plural chilies or chillies; but even so, the spelling remains a source of much confusion. Some individual chili peppers have separate entries.",

Designated by the Spanish word cilantro, meaning its leaves, the fresh herb has been reintroduced and accepted in the United States and Europe in the last few decades. The distinctive flavor can be an acquired taste, also an example of cultural prejudice or fashion in food; the derivation from the Greek word for bedbug, whose smell it is said to resemble, is now also in question. Besides cilantro, coriander, always used fresh, is called Chinese parsley in the West; the Chinese Mandarin name for the leaves is xiāng cài, the Cantonese yim sai (“fragrant vegetable”).

An eggshell is made of hard but porous calcium carbonate, enclosing a thin membrane, a small air pocket at one end, a transparent egg white surrounding a yellow yolk anchored by two white threads called chalazae. An egg is a powerhouse of nutrition, the watery white mostly protein, the dense, rich yolk containing fat, cholesterol, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, as well as lecithin. Although the yolk of one large egg contains 213 milligrams of cholesterol and 4½ grams of fat, a third of it saturated, recent studies suggest that moderate consumption of eggs has little effect on blood cholesterol levels. Fertile eggs, despite popular belief, have no nutritional advantage. The hen’s breed determines the color of the shell; the type of feed determines the color of the yolk. Fresher eggs are cohesive and shelled stand higher in a dish. Eggs are sold in six sizes; most standard recipes use large. Besides the familiar chicken eggs, duck and quail are available, and occasionally those of other birds. See also SALMONELLA.",

The olive, never eaten raw, can be cured by several methods: in water, brine, oil, lye, or dry-curing in salt. Of many types, Greece produces Kalamata, large, unpitted, richly pungent, purple-black; and Naphlion, black, bitter, dry salt-cured. French Niçoise are brine-cured with stems on, small, brown, and salty; Picholine are larger, briny, and green. Italian Gaeta are dry and wrinkled, Liguria tart.

Laws vary from country to country, but extra-virgin is best, followed by virgin, fino, and olive oil (formerly pure). “Light” olive oil, recently marketed in the United States, has little flavor, the same nutritional and caloric profile as other olive oil, and a higher smoke point; its best use is for cooking at high heat. Olive oil is primarily monounsaturated compared to other vegetable oils. See also OIL.",

In the United States today, the thin-skinned, juicy, seedy Valencia is good for eating and juice, grown in Florida and California; its origin is Portuguese, not Spanish. The West Coast navel, named for its distinctive bulge, is early, large, thick-skinned, seedless, with distinct segments, ideal for dessert, but its juice turns bitter with exposure. The blood orange, prized in Italy and the Mediterranean for its luscious raspberry color, is gaining acceptance in the United States.

White pepper is the same berry ripened further but with the black outer skin removed before drying, with a milder and slightly different flavor; white pepper is used in pale sauces for aesthetic reasons and is often preferred in Europe. Green peppercorns are berries picked unripe and pickled in brine without being dried in the sun.

Unrelated to the pepper family are fagara (Szechuan) and sansho (Japanese pepper), as are both pink and red peppercorns.

In general, smaller peppers are hotter than larger ones, and as they ripen from green to yellow to red, their flavor changes and gains heat. The fire can be measured in Scoville Heat Units, a scientific method devised in 1912, which allots 0 for a bell pepper, 4,000 to 10,000 for a jalapeño, and 300,000 for the hottest habanero. With repeated consumption, the chili eater gains tolerance, also a seeming addiction. Originating in South America, chili peppers are used in many cuisines the world over, with regional preferences. In common usage the word chili implies hot peppers, no botanical relation to black pepper, an error first made by Columbus, who thought the chilies he found in the West Indies were the black pepper of the Indies. The plural of the Spanish word chile is chiles; the English spelling is either chili (American) or chilli (more often British), with the plural chilies or chillies; but even so, the spelling remains a source of much confusion.

"satsuma":"The citrus tree whose fruit is generally darker, flatter, and smaller than the orange; its distinctive loose skin, fibrous inside, in some varieties slips off easily. Americans call it tangerine, for its route west through Tangiers, but most countries call it mandarin. Crossbreeding has led to much confusion in this family. The clementine and satsuma are types of mandarin. The tangor is a mandarin-orange hybrid; the Temple is one exemplar.

Savory is also an herb in the mint family known since Roman times and used traditionally with beans, meat, and poultry.",

The small Mexican calico scallop, from deep water, is sometimes confused with the bay scallop.

"Scotch woodcock":"A British SAVORY of creamy scrambled eggs on toast with anchovies.",
"Scoville Heat Unit":"The fruit of the pepper plant, from the genus Capsicum, ranging in its many varieties from mild to fiery hot, along with other flavor components; the chili’s pungency is concentrated in the capsaicin in the white rib tissue and attached seeds, which should be handled with care or even plastic disposable gloves. In general, smaller peppers are hotter than larger ones, and as they ripen from green to yellow to red, their flavor changes and gains heat. The fire can be measured in Scoville Heat Units, a scientific method devised in 1912, which allots 0 for a bell pepper, 4,000 to 10,000 for a jalapeño, and 300,000 for the hottest habanero. With repeated consumption, the chili eater gains tolerance, also a seeming addiction. Originating in South America, chili peppers are used in many cuisines the world over, with regional preferences. In common usage the word chili implies hot peppers, no botanical relation to black pepper, an error first made by Columbus, who thought the chilies he found in the West Indies were the black pepper of the Indies. The plural of the Spanish word chile is chiles; the English spelling is either chili (American) or chilli (more often British), with the plural chilies or chillies; but even so, the spelling remains a source of much confusion. Some individual chili peppers have separate entries.",
